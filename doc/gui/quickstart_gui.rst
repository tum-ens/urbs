How to start
============
Welcome to the graphical input for urbs. Let's get strated!

After opening the GUI of urbs you will find only an empty input window. To
understand how an urbs model looks like open the example
'Business_park_city.json' from the preset folder by selecting
**File -> Load configuration** in the menu. There will be a warning that
loading an external configuration will erase all your data. Since you have no
data yet you can just ignore it by clicking ok. The example configuration is
already executable. You can run it clicking the play button. The results of
your optimization will then be stored under 'Documents/urbs/result'

To understand what to look for and how to prepare your own model input with the
GUI, proceed with the Tutorial for graphical user interface in the online
documentation
https://urbs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ .
