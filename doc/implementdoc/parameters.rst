Parameters
==========
All the parameters that the optimization model requires to calculate an optimal
solution will be listed and defined in this section. A parameter is a
datapoint, that is provided by the user before the optimization simulation
starts. These parameters are the values that define the specifications of the
modelled energy system. Parameters of this optimization model can be separated
into two main parts, these are Technical and Economical Parameters.
