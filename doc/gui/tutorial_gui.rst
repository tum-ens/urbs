Tutorial for graphical user interface
=====================================
In this tutorial the usage of the graphical user interface (GUI) of urbs will
be exlained in detail. The graphical user interface allows for the same
functionality as the excel sheet based input for the program urbs and result
excel-sheets and images will be identical. As an example a business park next
to a city will be considered. Apart from the menu **File**, where you can save
or load configurations all information is edited on the tab level.

Basic tabs
^^^^^^^^^^
The GUI has three types of tabs:

* Overview
* Transmission
* Reference energy systems

The latter type occurs for each location modeled. The other two exist always
just once.

In the **Overview** tab you can set the basic layout of the model to
be optimized. Here you specify on the one hand the modeled locations and years
and give, on the other hand, global paramters for the modeling as, e.g., the
modeled time steps or some scenarios.

In the **Transmission** tab connections between different modeled locations are
specified.

The tabs for **Reference energy systems** (RES) are where the main
technological and economical parameters of the units that comprise the energy
supply infrastructure are specified. Thus, most model parameters are set here.
There is one tab for each modeled location which is automatically generated
once the location is specified in the overview tab.

In the following the three types of tabs are presented in more detail and the
individual buttons are explained.
