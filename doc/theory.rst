Mathematical description
************************

In this Section the **mathematical description** of a model generated by urbs
will be explained. The structure here follows the basic code structure and
proceeds as follows:

First, a short introduction into the type of optimization problem solvable with
urbs is given. This is followed by the description of the minimal possible
model in urbs. As a next step the two main expansions of models, which also
increase the index depth of all variables and parameters are discussed in the
parts 'Intertemporal modeling' and 'Multinode modeling'. The description is
then concluded by the additional description of various feature modules. The
latter are discussed in full index depth, i.e., with all features introduced in
minimal, intertemporal and multinode modeling.
