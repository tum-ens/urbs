Variables
=========
All the variables that the optimization model requires to calculate an optimal
solution will be listed and defined in this section.
A variable is a numerical value that is determined during optimization.
Variables can denote a single, independent value, or an array of
values. Variables define the search space for optimization.
Variables of this optimization model can be seperated into sections by their area of use.
These Sections are Cost, Commodity, Process, Transmission and Storage.

Cost Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
**Total System Cost**, :math:`\zeta` : the variable :math:`\zeta` represents
the *annual total expense incurred* in reaching the satisfaction of the given energy demand.
This is calculated by the sum total of all costs by type(:math:`\zeta_r`, :math:`\forall r \in R`) and defined as  ``costs`` by the following code fragment:

::

    m.costs = pyomo.Var(
        m.cost_type,
        within=pyomo.Reals,
        doc='Costs by type (EUR/a)')

More information on calculation of this variable is available at the `Cost Function`_ section.

Total System costs by type: System costs are divided into 6 cost types by their meaning and purpose.
The separation of costs by type, facilitates business planning and provides calculation accuracy
As mentioned before these cost types are hardcoded, which means they are not considered to be fixed or changed by the user.
These cost types are as following;

	**Investment Costs** :math:`\zeta_\text{inv}` : The variable :math:`\zeta_\text{inv}` represents the annualised total investment costs.
		Costs for required new investments on storage, process and transmission technologies.
	
	**Fix Costs** :math:`\zeta_\text{fix}` : The variable :math:`\zeta_\text{fix}` represents the annualised total fix costs.
		Fix costs for all used storage, process, and transmission technologies. Such as maintenance costs.
		
	**Variable Costs** :math:`\zeta_\text{var}` : The variable :math:`\zeta_\text{var}` represents the annualised total variables costs.
		Variable costs that are reliant on the usage amount and period of the storage, process, transmission technologies.
		
	**Fuel Costs** :math:`\zeta_\text{fuel}` : The variable :math:`\zeta_\text{fuel}` represents the annualised total fuel costs.
		Fuel costs are dependent on the usage of stock commodities( :math:`\forall c \in C_\text{stock}`).
		
	**Revenue Costs** :math:`\zeta_\text{rev}` : The variable :math:`\zeta_\text{rev}` represents the annualised total revenue costs.
		Revenue costs is defined for the costs that occures by selling the sell commodities( :math:`\forall c \in C_\text{sell}`).
		Since this variable is an income for the system, it is either zero or has a negative value.
		
	**Purchase Costs** :math:`\zeta_\text{pur}` : The variable :math:`\zeta_\text{pur}` represents the annualised total purchase costs.
		Purchase costs is defined for the costs that occures by buying the buy commodities ( :math:`\forall c \in C_\text{buy}` ).

	**Startup Costs** :math:`\zeta_\text{startup}` : The variable :math:`\zeta_\text{startup}` represents the annualised total startup costs.
		Startup costs are reliant on the yearly startup occurences of the processes.
		
	For more information on calculation of these variables see `Cost Function`_ section.

For further information see Process Capacity Rule.
This variable is expressed in the unit MW.

By default, process throughput is represented by the major input commodity flow of the process (e.g. 'Gas' for 'Gas plant', 'Wind' for 'Wind park'). Based on the process throughput amount in a given timestep of a process, flow amounts of the process' input and output commodities at that timestep can be calculated by scaling the process throughput with corresponding process input and output ratios.

**Storage Energy Content**, :math:`\epsilon_{vst}^\text{con}`, ``e_sto_con``: The variable :math:`\epsilon_{vst}^\text{con}` represents the energy amount that is loaded in a storage tuple :math:`s_{vc}` at a timestep :math:`t`. This variable is expressed in the unit MWh. In script ``urbs.py`` this variable is defined by the model variable ``e_sto_out`` and initialized by the following code fragment:
::

    m.e_sto_con = pyomo.Var(
        m.t, m.sto_tuples,
        within=pyomo.NonNegativeReals,
        doc='Energy content of storage (MWh) in timestep')

**DSM Upshift**, :math:`\delta_{vct}^\text{up}`, ``dsm_up``, MW: The variable :math:`\delta_{vct}^\text{up}` represents the DSM upshift in time step :math:`t` in site :math:`v` for commodity :math:`c`. It is only defined for all ``dsm_site_tuples``. The following code fragment shows the definition of the variable:
::

    m.dsm_up = pyomo.Var(
        m.tm, m.dsm_site_tuples,
        within=pyomo.NonNegativeReals,
        doc='DSM upshift')
        
**DSM Downshift**, :math:`\delta_{vct,tt}^\text{down}`, ``dsm_down``, MW: The variable :math:`\delta_{vct,tt}^\text{down}` represents the DSM downshift in timestepp :math:`tt` caused by the upshift in time :math:`t` in site :math:`v` for commodity :math:`c`. The special combinations of timesteps :math:`t` and :math:`tt` for each site and commodity combination is created by the ``dsm_down_tuples``. The definition of the variable is shown in the code fragment:
::
    m.dsm_down = pyomo.Var(
        m.dsm_down_tuples,
        within=pyomo.NonNegativeReals,
        doc='DSM downshift')
